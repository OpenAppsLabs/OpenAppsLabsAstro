        <strong>TL;DR:</strong> Coffee is a simple utility. It does not collect data. It only uses system permissions to keep your screen awake when toggled.

          <h2>01. Permissions</h2>
          <p>
            This app interacts with the Android System settings solely to prevent the screen from sleeping. No other background activities are performed.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>WAKE_LOCK</strong>
              <span class="muted">Allows the app to signal the OS to keep the CPU and Screen active.</span>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>FOREGROUND_SERVICE</strong>
              <span class="muted">Required to show the active notification while the timer is running, as mandated by Android.</span>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>02. Data Collection</h2>
          <p>
            I do not track when you turn the screen on or off. I do not store usage logs, analytics, or device identifiers. 
            The app operates <strong>100% locally</strong> on your device.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>03. Third-Party Services</h2>
          <p>
            There are no advertisements, no tracking SDKs, and no cloud-sync features. The app does not communicate with any external servers.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>04. Security</h2>
          <p>
            Since no data is collected, there is no personal information to secure or lose. Any local app preferences (like timer duration) stay on your device.
          </p>
