# 👋 Hi there,

I’m learning Android development and exploring AI — just for fun and growth. I build open-source Android apps, aiming for clean, maintainable code and continuous learning.  
I previously worked in web development (AEM); now I’m shifting my focus to Android and mobile-first ideas. I use AI in dev.
Now I am making Open Apps - Bunch of open source , useful apps.
